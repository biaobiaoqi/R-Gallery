R-Gallery
=========

This project is a simple Ruby practice.

I used [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) to build a simple API to support [Gallery](https://github.com/biaobiaoqi/Gallery) prject.

The API provide a list of urls of pictures which is stored in [qiniu](qiniu.com).

As it's a simple example, data are stored in yaml files. It's maintained manually.
